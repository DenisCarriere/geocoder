Geocoder: Simple, Consistent
============================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

Simple and consistent geocoding library written in Python.

Many online providers such as Google & Bing have geocoding services,
these providers do not include Python libraries and have different
JSON responses between each other.

It can be very difficult sometimes to parse a particular geocoding provider 
since each one of them have their own JSON schema. 

Here is a typical example of retrieving a Lat & Lng from Google using Python, 
things shouldn't be this hard.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import requests
    >>> url = 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json'
    >>> params = {'sensor': 'false', 'address': 'Mountain View, CA'}
    >>> r = requests.get(url, params=params)
    >>> results = r.json()['results']
    >>> location = results[0]['geometry']['location']
    >>> location['lat'], location['lng']
    (37.3860517, -122.0838511)

Now lets use Geocoder to do the same task.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> g = geocoder.google('Mountain View, CA')
    >>> g.latlng
    [37.3860517, -122.0838511]

    Very good companion for Geocoder. Glad to see Python getting more geo libraries for Non-GIS users.
