GeocodeFarm
===========

Geocode.Farm is one of the few providers that provide this highly
    specialized service for free. We also have affordable paid plans, of
    course, but our free services are of the same quality and provide the same
    results. The major difference between our affordable paid plans and our
    free API service is the limitations. On one of our affordable paid plans
    your limit is set based on the plan you signed up for, starting at 25,000
    query requests per day (API calls). On our free API offering, you are
    limited to 250 query requests per day (API calls).
